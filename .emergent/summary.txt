The trajectory details the transition of the FinClick.AI project from initial UI/UX refinement to the ambitious development of its core financial analysis engine. Initially, the AI engineer addressed extensive user feedback regarding homepage elements, footer links, header navigation, icon styling, and the detailed content for various legal and policy pages. This involved iterative UI adjustments, creation of placeholder content pages, and robust backend configuration for user authentication. A significant interlude focused on assisting the non-technical user with project backup and resolving GitHub push protection issues related to  files. Following the successful completion of these frontend and infrastructure tasks, the user provided a highly detailed and visionary product requirement document for the application's core functionality: an AI-powered financial analysis platform capable of 116+ analysis types. The AI engineer has just begun implementing the first phase of this new, complex system, starting with the foundational dashboard and backend analysis engine structure.

<product_requirements>
FinClick.AI is envisioned as a revolutionary AI-powered SaaS for automated financial analysis, designed to ingest financial data in any format, structure it to IFRS standards, and enrich it with global market data using various APIs and AI agents. The system must perform over 116 types of detailed financial analyses, generating interactive dashboards, automated multi-page reports (Word, Excel, PDF) and presentations (PPT, PDF), all within seconds. Key features include full Arabic/English bilingual support, secure user management (Subscriber, Admin, Guest accounts with provided credentials), and multi-level benchmarking (Saudi, GCC, global regions).

The initial build focused on a homepage with a live stock ticker, Hero Section, Why FinClick.AI?, Usage Steps, Analysis Types, Free Tools, Client Testimonials, and Pricing sections. A new header () and a footer (embedded in ) were developed. Multiple static content pages for company policies (About, Privacy, Terms, Manual, Policies, Other Policies, Security, Compliance) were also created and routed.

The current phase demands an advanced dashboard for users to upload up to 10 financial documents (PDF, Excel, Word, JPG, Scan) for 1-10 years, manually input data, and select analysis parameters (Company Name, Language, Sector (50+ options), Activity, Legal Entity (10+), Comparison Level, Analysis Type). The system will then perform OCR, data cleaning, enrichment, and the 116+ analyses, presenting results via a comprehensive template including definitions, calculations, detailed textual interpretations, industry comparisons, SWOT analysis, risks, forecasts, ratings (Excellent, Good, Weak with colors), strategic recommendations, and printable reports/presentations (50+ pages/slides). Non-functional requirements emphasize analysis speed (<30s), UI responsiveness (<3s), data security (isolation, encryption, secure auth), high accuracy (<0.01% error), and scalability for hundreds of concurrent users.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed the initial phase of fixing and refining the FinClick.AI application's homepage UI/UX, including header functionality, footer links, content for new policy pages, and setting up basic user authentication credentials in the backend.

The user then provided an extensive and highly detailed product requirement document for the *next, major phase* of the project: building the core Revolutionary Intelligent Financial Analysis System. This involves implementing an AI-powered platform capable of performing 116+ types of financial analyses, ingesting diverse data formats, enriching data, and generating comprehensive reports and interactive dashboards.

The AI engineer has just commenced working on the initial steps of this new, ambitious project phase. This involved:
1.  **Creating **: This new frontend page () is intended to serve as the main interface for the revolutionary analysis system, though it is currently empty.
2.  **Updating **: The main React router () was modified to include the route for the .
3.  **Updating **: The existing dashboard page () was updated to link or redirect to the newly created , making it the entry point for the new analysis features.
4.  **Creating **: A new Python file () was created in the backend, which will house the complex logic for performing the 116+ financial analyses. This file is currently empty.

The AI engineer is currently in the process of integrating this new backend module by adding a corresponding API endpoint in .
